        Football is often referred to as a universal language that is spoken globally. Technique is the vocabulary of football and it’s the base from which all soccer players are created. Soccer technique can be split into 3 main areas which must be mastered to be a top player.
        Ball mastery & control – The ability to collect, control and manipulate the ball with both feet, legs, chest & head.
        Dribbling & running with the ball – moving the ball in different directions at varying speeds with the ball in full control.
        Body movement & shapes – How you move your body efficiently with and without the ball to maximise impact with balance and coordination.
        Just like learning a language, it does not happen overnight and will take years of learning with many hours of repetition. To be able to accomplish this is heavily dependent on the next soccer attribute.

        Passion & Drive – The ambition and hunger to succeed. Often it is said that you either have it or you don’t. It’s that fire burning inside that comes to life on the football pitch.
        Mental toughness – In times of adversity, how does a player react? There are many highs and lows in a football journey and this trait often distinguishes those that can handle the pressure and make it to the top.
        Leadership – This is measured in different ways. You have leaders that organise and are vocal like John Terry or Tony Adams and those that lead by example like Steven Gerrard or Lionel Messi. Either way will work and it is a great asset to have.
        Coachability – As a player you need to be able to accept the feedback from coaches and teachers who are there to help you improve your game. How do players react or respond to instructions, criticism and suggestions? Are they open to learning new things?
        Self-Motivate – You hear stories about elite players staying back for extra training or spending hours upon hours mastering skills and techniques. This self-motivation to always want to better themselves by continuously learning and mastering can be a measure to the success of the player.      </div>

        Spatial Awareness – Players need to quickly visualise and understand the pictures that are created on
        the football pitch. Where are the players standing or moving and what are the distances and spaces in relation to the ball? How quickly can you create these pictures to help you make a decision as to your next move?
        Risk assessment – What happens if I run into this space or if I pass a ball into that space? Are you able to make the right decision that will have 
        a positive impact for your team and minimise the risk. Just as in life, previous experiences help you make these decisions and football is no different. That is why you train and practice to help make those decisions but there are added elements like creativity, logic and taking a chance which will give the edge.

        Football is a team sport where you win together and you lose together. 
        There have been many occasions where you could say that one player above all others is the reason for a team’s success such as Diego Maradona’s time at Napoli in 
        the 1980’s along with recent successes of Ronaldo and Messi but they all relied on their team mates to help bring that success and they will all acknowledge that. As a collective and harmonised unit,
        the team will generally perform much better so it is key for a player to be able to operate to their
        maximum ability within this environment.
        Saying that it can often be the individual that does something special in a game that raises the level of the team. It could be a superb bit of skill, a great goal or a great tackle. The effort that you put in
        will generally rub off on others so there is no excuse for not putting in 100% effort      </div>
