        <strong>Football is often referred to as a universal language that is spoken globally. Technique is the vocabulary of football and it’s the base from which all soccer players are created.
          Soccer technique can be split into 3 main areas which must be mastered to be a top player.Ball mastery & control –
          The ability to collect, control and manipulate the ball with both feet, legs, chest & head.
          Dribbling & running with the ball – moving the ball in different directions at varying speeds with the ball in full control.
          Body movement & shapes – How you move your body efficiently with and without the ball to maximise impact with balance and coordination.
          Just like learning a language, it does not happen overnight and will take years of learning with many hours of repetition. To be able to accomplish this is heavily dependent on the next soccer attribute.

        <strong>This is the second item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
