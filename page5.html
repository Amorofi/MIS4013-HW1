          Exercise can help prevent excess weight gain or help you keep off lost weight. 
          When you take part in physical activity, you burn calories. The more intense the activity, the more calories you burn.
          Regular trips to the gym are great, but don't worry if you can't find a large chunk of time to exercise every day.
          Any amount of activity is better than none. To gain the benefits of exercise, just get more active throughout your day.
          For example, take the stairs instead of the elevator or rev up your household chores. Consistency is key

        Worried about heart disease? Hoping to prevent high blood pressure?
        No matter what your current weight is, being active boosts high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol,
        the "good" cholesterol, and it decreases unhealthy triglycerides. This one-two punch keeps your blood flowing smoothly, 
        which lowers your risk of heart and blood vessel, called cardiovascular, diseases.

        Need an emotional lift? Or need to lower stress after a stressful day? A gym session or brisk walk can help.
        Physical activity stimulates many brain chemicals that may leave you feeling happier, more relaxed and less anxious. 
        You also may feel better about your appearance and yourself when you exercise regularly, which can boost your confidence and improve your self-esteem.

        Just don't exercise too close to bedtime, or you may be too energized to go to sleep.
